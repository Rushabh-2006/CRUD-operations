# CRUD-operations
 The CRUD operations manage employee records efficiently. The Add Employee module collects details through a form, processed by a servlet and saved using JDBC. The View Employee module fetches all employee data via a SELECT query and displays it on a JSP page, helping users view and manage records easily.
